# Porffolio

Portfolio is a webpage where people can share their work in proyects, creating
an online porftolio for futures references and inspiration.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing
For using this proyect you will need to:

Install all gems in the proyect

```
bundle install
```

Create Database if it dont exist
